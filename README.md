# terraform-aws-lambda [![Build Status](https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda/workflows/Lint/badge.svg)](https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda/actions) [![Latest Release](https://img.shields.io/github/release/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda.svg)](https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda/releases/latest) [![Semantic Release](https://img.shields.io/badge/%20%20%F0%9F%93%A6%F0%9F%9A%80-semantic--release-e10079.svg)](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release)


Terraform module designed to facilitate the creation of AWS Lambda functions.


---


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).





## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda/releases).


### Simple Example

```hcl
module "lambda" {
  source        = "git::https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda.git?ref=master"
  function_name = "test-service"
  handler       = "service/handler"
  source_dir    = var.source_dir
  runtime       = var.runtime

  rsync_pattern = [
    "--include=*.js"
  ]
}
```
### Advanced Example

```hcl
locals {
  service_dir = "account-data"
}

module "lambda" {
  source        = "git::https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-aws-lambda.git?ref=master"
  function_name = "test-service"
  handler       = "${local.service_dir}/handler"
  source_dir    = var.source_dir
  runtime       = var.runtime
  layers        = var.layers

  rsync_pattern = [
    "--include=lib/",
    "--include=domain/",
    "--include=${local.service_dir}/",
    "--include=*.js"
  ]

  policy = {
    json = data.aws_iam_policy_document.main.json
  }

  environment = {
    variables = {
      SM_SERVICE_CONFIG = var.pfs_secrets_manager_secret.arn
    }
  }

  vpc_config = {
    subnet_ids = var.private_subnet_ids

    security_group_ids = [
      var.security_group_id
    ]
  }

  tags = {
    "Team" = "XYZ"
  }
}
```

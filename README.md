Terraform module designed to facilitate the creation of New Relic AWS Lambda alerts.


---


It's 100% Open Source and licensed under the [APACHE2](LICENSE).





## Usage


**IMPORTANT:** The `master` branch is used in `source` just as an example. In your code, do not pin to `master` because there may be breaking changes between releases.
Instead pin to the release tag (e.g. `?ref=tags/x.y.z`) of one of our [latest releases](https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-newrelic-alert-lambda/releases).


### Simple Example

```hcl
module "newrelic_alert" {
  source           = "git::https://github.com/enter-at/terraform-newrelic-alert-lambda.git?ref=master"
  function_name    = aws_lambda_function.main.function_name
  function_arn     = aws_lambda_function.main.arn
  function_timeout = aws_lambda_function.main.timeout
  policy_id        = newrelic_alert_policy.main.id
}
```
